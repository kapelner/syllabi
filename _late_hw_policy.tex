\subsection*{Late Assignment Policy}

Late homework will be penalized 10 points per business day (Monday--Friday save New York State's \href{https://nysomce.org/page/legalholidays}{legal holidays}) for a maximum of five days. \textit{Do not ask for extensions}; just submit the homework late. After five days, \textbf{you can hand it in whenever you want} until \emph{the last scheduled class meeting according to the official academic calendar}. As far as I know, this is one of the most lenient and flexible homework policies in college. I realize things come up. Do not abuse this policy; you will fall far, far behind.
