\subsection*{Announcements}

Course announcements will be made via discord in the \texttt{\#general} channel (not on email). I am known to send a few discord messages per week on important issues.

I can't stress the following enough: \inred{if you are not on discord, you will miss all class announcements!!!} Discord notifies you when there are messages.
