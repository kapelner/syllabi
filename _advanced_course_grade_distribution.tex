\subsection*{The Grade Distribution}

As this is a small and advanced class; thus, the class curve will be quite generous. Last year, it was approximately 40\% A's and 40\% B's. If you do your homework and demonstrate understanding on the exams, you should expect to be rewarded with an A or a B. C's are for those who can only demonstrate basic understanding. F's are rare, but occur.
