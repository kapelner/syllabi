\subsection*{The Grade Distribution}

As this is a small and advanced class, the class curve will be quite generous. Last year, it was approximately 40\% A's and 40\% B's. If you do your homework and demonstrate understanding on the exams, you should expect to be rewarded with an A or a B. C's are for those who \qu{dropped out} somewhere mid-semester or who cannot demonstrate basic understanding. I have never given an F in this class. Don't give me a reason to change this tradition!
