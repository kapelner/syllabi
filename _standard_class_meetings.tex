\section*{Class Meetings}

There are 28 scheduled meetings. Of these, 23 will be lectures, 2 will be midterm exams which are in class and 3 will be review periods (the meeting before the exams). The exam schedule is given on page~\pageref{subsec:exam_schedule}. The last class of the semester (Dec 9) will be rescheduled to be a review period that is conveniently before the final. We will discuss later in the semester. %I have a no computer / tablet / phone policy during lectures. Only pen / pencil and paper.
