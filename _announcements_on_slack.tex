\subsection*{Announcements}

Course announcements will be made via slack in the \texttt{\#general} channel (not on email). I am known to send a few slack messages per week on important issues. The Slack workspace \texttt{\#general} channel is also connected to the \coursewebpagelink~via an integration. So every time I change the homepage (e.g. to release a new homework or upload notes or a video), you will get a notification.

I can't stress the following enough: \inred{if you are not on slack, you will miss all class announcements!!!} Slack notifies you when there are messages. You may wish to mute all channels except for \#general. See \href{https://slack.com/help/articles/204411433-Mute-channels-and-direct-messages}{this article} for how to do that.
