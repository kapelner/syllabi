Course announcements will be made via slack in the \#general channel (not on email). I am known to send a few slack messages per week on important issues. \inred{If you are not on slack, you will miss all class announcements!!!} We will discuss how to sign up to slack in the section on Homework \#0 (page \pageref{subsec:homework_zero}).
