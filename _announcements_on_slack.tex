Course announcements will be made via slack in the \#general channel (not on email). I am known to send a few slack messages per week on important issues. \inred{If you are not on slack, you will miss all class announcements!!!} Slack notifies you when there are messages. You may wish to mute all channels except for \#general. See \href{https://slack.com/help/articles/204411433-Mute-channels-and-direct-messages}{this article} for how to do that.
