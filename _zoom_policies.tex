\subsubsection*{Zoom Policies}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use your real name as the display name. This is important for auditing for the attendance score.
\item Your video must always be on and your sound should always be on (except in cases of background noise)
\item You can use an appropriate background but it must be a static image. 
\item No snap camera or similar nonsense. No chatting on zoom.
\item No text chatting or verbal chatting with other students (no talking in class!)
\end{itemize}
