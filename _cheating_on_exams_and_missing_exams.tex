\subsection*{Cheating on Exams}

If I catch you cheating, you can either take a zero on the exam, or you can roll the dice before the University Honor Council who may choose to suspend you. %\inred{I have extremely elaborate means to detect cheating on my zoom exams. These means have been iterated upon and improved for three semesters. I suggest you don't try me.}


\subsection*{Missing Exams}

There are no make-up exams. If you miss the exam, you get a zero. If you are sick, I need documentation of your visit to a hospital or doctor. Expect me to call the doctor or hospital to verify the legitimacy of your note. %If you need to leave the country for an emergency, I will expect proper documentation as well.
