\subsection*{Time Spent on Homework }

This is a four credit course. Thus, the amount of work outside of the 4hr in-class time per week is 8-12 hours. I will aim for 10hr of homework per week on average. However, doing the homework well is your sole responsibility since I will make sure that by doing the homework you will study and understand the concepts in the lectures and you won't have all that much to do when the exams roll around.
