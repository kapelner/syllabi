\subsection*{Time Spent on Homework}

This is a four credit course. Thus, the amount of work outside of the \numcredits~hours in-class time per week is \numhrshwsrange~hours per the QC bulletin. I will aim for \numhrshwtarget~hours of homework per week on average. This will be time well-spent. I guarantee that by doing the homework well, you will study and understand the concepts in the lectures and you won't have all that much to do when the exams roll around.
