\subsection*{Collaboration Policy on all Class Assignments}

\ingreen{You are highly recommended to work with each other and help each other.} \inred{You must, however, submit your own solutions, \textit{with your own write-up} and in \textit{your own words}. There can be no collaboration on the actual \textit{writing}. Failure to comply will result in severe penalties.} The university honor code is something I take seriously and I send people to the Dean every semester for violations.
