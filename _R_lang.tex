\paragraph{Computer Software:} During lectures, there will be demos using \texttt{R} which is a free, open source statistical programming language and console. You can download it from: \url{http://cran.mirrors.hoobly.com/}. I do not expect you to do \textit{any} programming. If \texttt{R} will be part of the homework, I will give you the code to run and expect you to interpret the results based on concepts explained during the course.
