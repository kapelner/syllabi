\subsection*{Homework Extra Credit}

There will be many extra credit questions sprinkled throughout the homeworks. They will be worth a variable number of points arbitrarily assigned based on my perceived difficulty of the exercise. Homework scores in the 140's are not unheard of. They are a good boost to your grade; I once had a student go from a B to and A- based on these bonuses.
