\subsection*{Attendance}

Part of your grade will be based on attendance. Since the course is on zoom, I have a full audit of the second each of you enters and exits the \qu{classroom}. Your score will be computed automatically as the proportion of seconds you attended class divided by the total number of class seconds.
