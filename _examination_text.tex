Examinations are solely based on homeworks (which are rooted in the lectures)! If you can do all the green and yellow problems on the homeworks, the exams should not present any challenge. I will \textit{never} give you exam problems on concepts which you have not seen at home on one of the weekly homework assignments. There will be three exams and the schedule is below.
