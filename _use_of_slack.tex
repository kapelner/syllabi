\subsection*{The Use of Slack as a Learning Management System}

As the course homepage is updated (e.g. a new homework assignment is posted), you will hear about it in slack. You will also find the video recordings of lectures there. (If there are multiple sections of the class, only one section's lectures will be recorded). Each assignment will have its own channel. You can feel free to discuss things with your fellow students there. If you are asking me a question, you must do so in the \texttt{\#discussions} channel for a general questions or the assignment-specific channel (e.g. \texttt{\#HW03}) so other students can see the question and benefit from the answer. If you pm me, I will just ask you to move it to the public channel. Do not be afraid to ask questions. There are many people who will have your same question! 

Slack is a wildly successful company that recently got bought by Salesforce because businesses use it. Pretend you are working at one of these businesses: \inred{no posting about random stuff; keep things professional!}
