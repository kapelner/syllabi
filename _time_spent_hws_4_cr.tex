\subsection*{Time Spent on Homework }

This is a four credit course. Thus, the amount of work outside of the 4hr in-class time per week is 8-12 hours. I will aim for 10hr of homework per week on average. You can think of doing the homework well as \qu{sufficient} as \emph{my} job is to ensure that by \emph{you} doing the homework you will study and understand the concepts in the lectures and you won't have all that much to do when the exams roll around.
