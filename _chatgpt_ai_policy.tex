\subsection*{AI Policy}

ChatGPT, Gemini, perplexity, grok et al. (collectively \qu{AI}) is now an integral (and soon to be ubiquitous) part of the world we live in. Sometime in 2024, it reached the point where it can solve the at-home exercises in this course. 

On the one hand, this presents a monumental pedagogical challenge. As mentioned above, the exercises are the only way to truly learn the concepts. If you use AI to solve the questions on autopilot, you will never master the concepts. And the exams will subsequently crush you. 

On the other hand, the educated citizens of the future need to learn to leverage AI to avoid being left behind.

Bottom line: using modern AI platforms is \emph{not required} for this course. But here's my loose policy for those who wish to use AI for the at-home exercises:

\begin{itemize}
\item Try your best to do the HW exercise yourself. If you have an answer, check your answer with AI to see if you missed any steps.
\item If you cannot do the homework exercise after \emph{honestly trying}, treat the AI as your genius classmate who is allowed to help you. That is, look at the answer and then write the solution \emph{in your own words} and in the style, notation and dialect we use in this class. This paraphrasing exercise will be effective in helping you learn.
\end{itemize}
