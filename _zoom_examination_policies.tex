\subsection*{Zoom Exams}

Exams will be given on Zoom screen-shared from my computer. In a nutshell, each page of the PDF exam is a \qu{problem scenario} with text and/or illustrations. The questions that follow are enumerated a, b, c, d, etc. and they are all \qu{true or false} questions. You will enter the true question letters into a google form. Each problem scenario page is individually timed. Once the timer expires, you can no longer edit your answers.
