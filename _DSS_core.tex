As we've noted previously, there is an order the four classes need to be taken. Below are two plans, the first is over two semesters and hence it is not \emph{not recommended} as it will be a \emph{very} heavy workload. The second is over four semesters and it is the recommended plan as I believe it will allow students to absorb the material more effectively:
