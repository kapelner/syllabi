\subsection*{Discord Coupled with Github as a Learning Management System}

Each assignment and exam will have its own channel. You can feel free to discuss things with your fellow students there. If you are asking me a question, you must do so in the \texttt{\#discussions} channel for a general questions or the assignment-specific channel (e.g. \texttt{\#hw03}) so other students can see the question and benefit from the answer. Do \inred{not} open \qu{issues} on github! If you pm me for help with a class assignment, I will not answer and just ask you to move it to the appropriate public channel. Do not be afraid to ask questions. There are many people who will have your same question! 

Discord is to be used professionally so \inred{no posting about random stuff!}
