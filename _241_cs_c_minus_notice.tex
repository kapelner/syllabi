\subsection*{The Computer Science C- requirement}

This class is a required course for the Computer Science major and requires a minimum of a C- to earn credit for the major. I cannot assign grades based on student need. What I can do is let you know if you are in danger of getting a grade lower than C- after the first exam and after the second exam. The second exam is scheduled on the day of the Withdraw deadline and I will do my best to have them graded well before the deadline. 

If you are below the 25\%ile and you are a CS major, you are on the border of passing your requirement. If you do not plan on studying hard for the final and improving your grade, you may choose to withdraw, thereby allowing you to focus on other classes only to retake Math 241 in the future (and this time earn a stellar grade).
