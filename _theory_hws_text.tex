There will be \numtheoryhws theory homework assignments. Homeworks will be assigned and placed on the \coursewebpagelink~ and will usually be due a week later in class. Homework will be \textbf{graded} out of 100 with extra credit getting scores possibly $> 100$. I will be doing the grading and will grade an \textit{arbitrary subset of the assignment} which is determined after the homework is handed in.
