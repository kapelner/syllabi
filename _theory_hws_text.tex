There will be \numtheoryhws~theory homework assignments. Homeworks will be assigned and placed on the \coursewebpagelink~ and will usually be due a week later in class. Homework will be \textbf{graded} out of 100 with extra credit getting scores possibly $> 100$. I (or the TA if one exists) will be doing the grading and will either grade an \textit{arbitrary subset of the assignment} which is determined after the homework is handed in or \textit{will grade based on completeness}.
