I also allow \qu{cheat sheets} on examinations. For both midterms, you are allowed to bring \textit{one} 8.5'' $\times$ 11'' sheet of paper (front and back). \inred{Two sheets single sided are not allowed.} On this paper you can write anything you would like which you believe will help you on the exam. For the final, you are allowed to bring \textit{three} 8.5'' $\times$ 11'' sheet of paper (front and back). \inred{Six sheets single sided are not allowed.} I will be handing back the cheat sheets so you can reuse your midterm cheat sheets for the final if you wish.
